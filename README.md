# ElectroNow — Product Showcase

Static product showcase demo focused on CSS layout, responsive design, and UI micro-interactions.

How to run
- Open `index.html` in your browser, or run a local static server:

```
npx http-server .
```

What’s included
- `index.html` — product grid, modal, cart sidebar
- `css/styles.css` — design tokens, layout, dark mode, print
- Documentation files: CSS architecture, design system, compatibility, performance guidance

Notes & next steps
- Filtering/sorting UI is present but intentionally has no data-layer logic (per requirements).
- For production: compress images (WebP/AVIF), add server-side caching, and run Lighthouse to collect real scores.
